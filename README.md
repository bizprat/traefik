# Project Title

## Description
This project sets up a Traefik reverse proxy to manage routing for various services. It includes configurations for SSL using Let's Encrypt and a dashboard for monitoring.

## Setting Up Traefik
1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   TRAEFIK_ACME_EMAIL="sample@example.com"
   TRAEFIK_DASHBOARD_DOMAIN="traefik.yourdomain.com"
   ```
4. Run the following command to start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Using Traefik Network in Other Projects
To use the Traefik network in other Docker projects, ensure that the services are connected to the `traefik` network defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. This allows Traefik to route traffic to your services.

## Example Configuration
Refer to the `docker-compose.yml` file for an example of how to set up services with Traefik.
